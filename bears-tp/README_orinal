Project 2

In this folder you'll find the sample receiver, code for computing and
validating checksums, as well as example sender code.

Quick! What do I have to write?
===============================
Sender.py is the file in which you will implement your reliable sender. You do
not need to modify any other included files to complete this project. 
Sender.py provides all the scaffolding you need to handle the
command line arguments we will use in the grading of your project.
